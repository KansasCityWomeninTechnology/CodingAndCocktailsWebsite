          <h3>Install the Tools</h3>
          <h5>
            Before you begin, you'll need to install some programs and open a few accounts to help with your coding.  These are the tools many developers use on a regular basis.  If you encounter problems along the way, our mentors will be happy to assist you before or during a Coding &amp; Cocktails session.
