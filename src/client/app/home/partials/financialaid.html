      <h2>GitHub Diversity Scholarship</h2>
      <p>Kansas City Women in Technology alongside GitHub is dedicated to helping women of all backgrounds have access to technology education in our programs. Thanks to GitHub’s sponsorship we are pleased to be able to offer three(3) scholarships per month to attendees of underrepresented demographics. Want to find out more about how GitHub is working on diversity &amp; inclusion? <a href="https://github.com/blog/2176-diversity-and-inclusion-at-github" target="_blank">Read more here</a>.</p>
      <p>Scholarships from the GitHub Diversity Scholarship are need-based, and are available for three(3) attendees each month. Women (cis and trans) who are part of an underrepresented demographic in technology (African American, Latinx, and Native American, including Alaskan and Hawaiian) are eligible to apply for scholarships from this fund. Scholarships are awarded based on financial need, the applicant's ability to meet requirements, and the applicant’s level of commitment to ongoing learning and paying it forward. These spots are guaranteed even when events are sold out.</p>
